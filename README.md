Get most recent real time tweets from user's current location

Built a data visualizer for the most recent tweets based on user's current location.

- A maximum of 50 tweets are visible within a range of 5 kms from user's current location. Location can be set automatically and manually.

- Tweets are visible on the map in the form of pins.

- Tapping on pins show tweet details.

- If there are many pins at a location, they get clubbed together.

- Screen auto refreshes every 5 seconds to get most recent tweets.
